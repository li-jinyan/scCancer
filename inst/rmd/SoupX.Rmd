### `r h.i`.`r h.ii`.2 Ambient RNAs contamination fraction estimation

We refer to the algorithm of [`SoupX`](https://github.com/constantAmateur/SoupX) 
to estimate the contamination fraction of ambient RNAs from lysed cells.

Here is the plot from `SoupX`, which visualises the log10 ratios of observed expression counts to expected 
if the cell is pure background. The algorithm guesses which cells definitely express each gene and
estimates the contamination fraction (read lines) using just each gene (i.e., assuming the same contamination for all cells).

```{r soupX, echo=FALSE, message=F, dpi=300, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, fig.align="center"}
results$p.bg.genes
```

<span style="color:red">**Note:**</span> The `SoupX` emphasize that the genes 
in the plot are heuristic and are just used to help develop biological intuition. 
It absolutely **must not** be used to automatically select the top *N* genes from the list,
which may *over-estimate* the contamination fraction!

By default, we set three default gene sets (immunoglobulin, haemoglobin, and MHC genes) 
according to the characteristics of cancer microenvironment. 

Using the users' input or the default gene sets, following genes are used to eatimate the contamination fraction. 
```{r echo=F}
print(results$bg.spec.genes)
```

The estimated contamination fraction is <span style="color:red">` `r results$bg.rho * 100`% `</span>. 
Picking right genes which are specific to one of cell population is absolutely vital for
the accuracy of the estimated contamination fraction. 
So the fraction calculated here is **for reference only**, especially when 
just the default gene sets are used, without considering the sample-specific features.
