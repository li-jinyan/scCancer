### `r h.i`.`r h.ii` Cell interaction analysis
In order to analyze the ligand-receptor interactions between the various cell types in cancer micro-environment, 
we use a ligand-receptor database [`FANTOM5`](http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/data/), and estimate the interaction scores among cell sets (the default is clusters). 

The interaction scores between all ligand-receptor pairs and all cell sets can be found in the table file 
[InteractionScore.txt](./InteractionScore.txt). 

Here is a plot showing the number of ligand-receptor paris with score larger than 0.1 among clusters. 
The size of point means the number of ligand-receptor paris with scores larger than 0.1.
The color of point means the sum of the ligand-receptor pairs scores.
To compare conveniently, the bottom subplot shows the predicted cell type fraction of each cell set.

```{r cellInteractionPlot, echo=F, message=F, warning=F, dpi=300, fig.width=7, fig.height=6.5, fig.align="center", out.width='80%'}
grid::grid.draw(results$inter.plot)
```

Following are the top 10 scores ligand-receptor pairs.
```{r interaction.summary, echo=F}
format(head(results$interaction.score, 10), digits = 4)
```


```{r echo=F}
h.ii <- h.ii + 1
```
