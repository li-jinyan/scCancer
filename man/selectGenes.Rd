\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{liger} object. Should have already called normalize.}

\item{var.thresh}{Variance threshold. Main threshold used to identify variable genes. Genes with
expression variance greater than threshold (relative to mean) are selected.
(higher threshold -> fewer selected genes). Accepts single value or vector with separate
var.thresh for each dataset. (default 0.1)}

\item{alpha.thresh}{Alpha threshold. Controls upper bound for expected mean gene expression
(lower threshold -> higher upper bound). (default 0.99)}

\item{num.genes}{Number of genes to find for each dataset. Optimises the value of var.thresh
for each dataset to get this number of genes. Accepts single value or vector with same length
as number of datasets (optional, default=NULL).}

\item{tol}{Tolerance to use for optimization if num.genes values passed in (default 0.0001).}

\item{datasets.use}{List of datasets to include for discovery of highly variable genes.
(default 1:length(object@raw.data))}

\item{combine}{How to combine variable genes across experiments. Either "union" or "intersect".
(default "union")}

\item{keep.unique}{Keep genes that occur (i.e., there is a corresponding column in raw.data) only
in one dataset (default FALSE)}

\item{capitalize}{Capitalize gene names to match homologous genes (ie. across species)
(default FALSE)}

\item{do.plot}{Display log plot of gene variance vs. gene expression for each dataset.
Selected genes are plotted in green. (default FALSE)}

\item{cex.use}{Point size for plot.}

\value{
\code{liger} object with var.genes slot set.

\description{
This function identifies highly variable genes from each dataset and combines these gene sets
(either by union or intersection) for use in downstream analysis. Assuming that gene
expression approximately follows a Poisson distribution, this function identifies genes with
gene expression variance above a given variance threshold (relative to mean gene expression).
It also provides a log plot of gene variance vs gene expression (with a line indicating expected
expression across genes and cells). Selected genes are plotted in green.
