\title{Plot ratio of observed to expected counts on reduced dimension map}
\usage{
plotMarkerMap(sc, geneSet, DR, ratLims = c(-2, 2), FDR = 0.05, useToEst = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sc}{SoupChannel object.}

\item{geneSet}{A vector with the names of the genes to aggregate and plot evidence for.}

\item{DR}{A data.frame, with rows named by unique cell IDs (i.e., <ChannelName>_<Barcode>) the first two columns of which give the coordinates of each cell in some reduced dimension representation of the data.  Try and fetch automatically if missing.}

\item{ratLims}{Truncate log ratios at these values.}

\item{FDR}{False Discovery Rate for statistical test of enrichment over background.}

\item{useToEst}{A vector (usually obtained from \code{\link{estimateNonExpressingCells}}), that will be used to mark cells instead of the usual Poisson test.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 containing the plot.
}
\description{
Given some reduced dimensional representation of the data (such as UMAP or tSNE) that has been calculated however you would like, this provides a way to visualise how likely a set of genes are to be soup derived on that map.  That is, given a set of genes, this function calculates how many counts would be expected if that droplet were nothing but soup and compares that to the observed count.  This is done via a log2 ratio of the two values.  A Poisson test is performed and points that have a statistically significant enrichment over the background (at 5% FDR) are marked.
