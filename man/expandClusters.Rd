\title{Expands soup counts calculated at the cluster level to the cell level}
\usage{
expandClusters(clustSoupCnts, cellObsCnts, clusters, cellWeights, verbose = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{clustSoupCnts}{Matrix of genes (rows) by clusters (columns) where counts are number of soup counts for that gene/cluster combination.}

\item{cellObsCnts}{Matrix of genes (rows) by cells (columns) giving the observed counts}

\item{clusters}{Mapping from cells to clusters.}

\item{cellWeights}{Weighting to give to each cell when distributing counts.  This would usually be set to the number of expected soup counts for each cell.}

\item{verbose}{Integer giving level of verbosity.  0 = silence, 1 = Basic information, 2 = Very chatty, 3 = Debug.}
}
\value{
A matrix of genes (rows) by cells (columns) giving the number of soup counts estimated for each cell.  Non-integer values possible.
}
\description{
Given a clustering of cells and soup counts calculated for each of those clusters, determines a most likely allocation of soup counts at the cell level.
